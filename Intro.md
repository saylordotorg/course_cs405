Course Syllabus for "CS405: Artificial Intelligence"
----------------------------------------------------

CS405 introduces the field of artificial intelligence (AI).  Materials
on AI programming, logic, search, game playing, machine learning,
natural language understanding, and robotics introduce the student to AI
methods, tools, and techniques, their application to computational
problems, and their contribution to understanding intelligence.  Because
each of these topics could be a course unto itself, the material is
introductory and not complete.  Each unit presents the problem a topic
addresses, current progress, and approaches to the problem.  The
readings include and cite more materials that are referenced in this
course, and students are encouraged to use these resources to pursue
topics of interest after this course.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  
  

-   Describe the major applications, topics, and research areas of
    artificial intelligence (AI), including search, machine learning,
    knowledge representation and inference, natural language processing,
    vision, and robotics.
-   Apply basic techniques of AI in computational solutions to problems.
-   Discuss the role of AI research areas in growing the understanding
    of human intelligence.
-   Identify the boundaries of the capabilities of current AI systems.

**Requirements for Completion:** Passing grade on quizzes and the final
exam, achieve the objectives of each unit and the goals of the course,
ability to apply the concepts taught in the course.

**Time Requirements:** This course should take approximately **120
hours** to complete.

**Tips/Suggestions:** AI utilizes many disciplines, including
mathematics, logic, programming, psychology, neural biology,
linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy, as well as contributing
its own concepts and techniques, for building hardware and software
systems that perform intelligent tasks and activities.  This suggests
that AI be viewed as a discipline for integrating and applying knowledge
from many fields to discover computational solutions to problems, tasks,
and behaviors, which currently requires human capabilities.
