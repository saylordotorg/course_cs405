**Unit 1: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI
Programming** <span id="1"></span> 
*While AI applications can be developed in any number of different
languages, certain language features make programming AI applications
straightforward.  Prolog is structured in such a way that AI program
development is supported by Prolog language features.  Other languages,
such as Java, support AI programming through code libraries.  At this
point in your career as a computer science major, you have already taken
introductory programming courses; these should assist you in learning
Prolog and using code libraries in other languages for AI program
development.*  
 *   
 This unit will provide you with an introduction to AI via programming
features that support basic AI applications.  By satisfying the goals of
this unit, you will have a familiarity with AI programming and be able
to use it in future models to implement various AI applications.  *

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 10 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2: 8 hours
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2.1: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2.2: 4 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Describe the contributions and application of AI.
-   Characterize the goals of AI, approaches to and progress toward
    those goals.
-   Explain the role of programming in artificial intelligence (AI).
-   Describe logic programming and basic constructs used in AI
    programming.

    (PPT)  
        
     Instructions: Look over the slides in this introductory lecture,
    located in section 6, week 1, on the webpage.  It gives a good
    summary of the types and scope of AI applications and the state of
    the art in the fields.  This reading tells some of the early history
    of AI.  (The slides on game playing—in particular 10, 11, and
    15—apply to section 4.1.1 below, on the history of game playing in
    AI.)

    Programming with Java: “Chapter 1: Introduction”**
    Link: Mark Watson’s *Practical Artificial Intelligence Programming
    with Java*: “[Chapter 1:
    Introduction](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/CS405-1.1-WATSON.pdf)”
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read chapter 1, pages 1-4.  AI concepts and
    techniques are learned in two steps: theory, and implementation of
    theory in programs.  AI techniques are difficult to program and can
    be obscured by the programming details.  To make these techniques
    explicit and to hide the programming details, AI languages—such as
    Lisp, Prolog, Scheme, and others—have been defined to have language
    features that directly support the implementation of AI techniques. 
    The use of class libraries and source code libraries serve the same
    purpose for general-purpose languages, such as C++ and Java.  The
    Watson text uses Java Classes for program examples of AI concepts
    and techniques.  Java, being widely used, has the added advantage of
    making these techniques more widely available.

    Intelligence Course: “Chapter 11: Logic Programming”**
    Link: MIT: Kaelbling and Lozano-Perez 6.034 Artificial Intelligence

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Look over the slides in section 6.034 Notes: Section
    11.1, on logic as a programming language.  These slides depend on,
    at least, an introductory knowledge of logic.  If you need to, read
    unit 5, slides 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 through 5.2.2.3, for a review of
    basic logic.  
        
     In declarative programming, you write statements that specify how
    to manipulate the data, i.e., you write specific algorithms.  In
    logic programming, you write statements that specify what is true of
    the world represented and rely on general-purpose algorithms that
    are built into the logic (programming) system.
