**Unit 8: Robotics** <span id="8"></span> 
*Robotics draws upon and integrates previous topics, as well as
information and techniques from other disciplines, including many
engineering fields, physics, controls, probability and statistics,
differential equations, linguistics, and many applications, e.g.,
manufacturing, sensors, medical applications, etc.  Some of the
contributions of AI to robotics are search algorithms, representation
and models for the robot world, inference, learning, and AI programming
features and their integration. *
